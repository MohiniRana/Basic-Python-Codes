# Program to check if the number entered by user is either even or odd.
# For a number to be even, it has to be divisible by 2.
# Divisibility of 2 states that for a number to be divisible by 2, the remainder should be zero.
# In Python, we can do this by using the % (mod) operator and check if number%2 is equal to zero.
# If it is zero, the number is an even number, else it is an odd number.

# Code:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
    print(num, " is an even number")
else:
    print(num, " is an odd number")
    
    
    
 # Another method to print the same output-
 num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
    print("{} is an even number".format(num))
else:
    print("{} is an odd number".format(num))
