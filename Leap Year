# The logic for Leap Year is:
# The year should be evenly divisible by 4.
# The year should also be divisible by 100 but also should be divisible by 400 and not just 100.
# For instance, Year 1700 is divisible by 100 but it is not divisible by 400. Hence it is not a leap year.
# However, 2000 is a year divisible by 4, 100 and 400 as well. It is a therefore a leap year.

def is_leap(year):
    if year%4 == 0:
        if year%100 == 0:
            if year%400 == 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return True # this is true because the year is not divible by 100 implyin it is not a century, thus it could be a leap year and a multiple of 4.
    else:
        return False
    return year
